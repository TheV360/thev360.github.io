				<h1>Comment Policy</h1>
				<p>This is just a few rules to ensure the comments don't become a dumpster fire.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't be a jerk.</li>
					<li>Don't use slurs, and try to limit the amount of curses you use.</li>
					<li>Try to be constructive.</li>
					<li>Try to include at least three numbers or one symbol in your comment.</li>
					<li>No spam.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you violate any of these rules, I'll probably delete your comment.</p>
