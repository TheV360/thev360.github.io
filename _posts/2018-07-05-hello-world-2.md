It's the truth. SmileBASIC is probably the best program you can get for your 3DS, in terms of raw functionality. SmileBASIC is a software development application for the Nintendo 3DS, developed by SmileBoom in Japan. Like its predecessor Petit Computer, SmileBASIC is built around a custom dialect of BASIC called SmileBASIC. With SmileBASIC, users can write programs that use the 3DS's features and then upload the programs (or folders containing programs) to an online repository, where they can be downloaded by entering a short code. Downloaded programs can also be edited and re-uploaded. Programs can utilize the 3DS's touchscreen, controls, speakers, gyroscopes, and 3D screen.<!--more-->
